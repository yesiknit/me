  - Date_Time = Main Notes
  - R = Reference
  - H = Hub Notes
    - Hub notes help you find trains of thought. A train of thought is a sequence of ideas found in your zettelkasten established when notes refer or link to one another.
  - S = Structure Notes
    - Structure notes are places to organize and "structure" the ideas that make up the trains of thought pointed to in your hub note, allowing you to arrange ideas and flesh out your thinking.
